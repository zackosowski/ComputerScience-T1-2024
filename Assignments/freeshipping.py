# Create a function called free_shipping
# That tells you if you qualify for free shipping or not
# You only get free shipping if
# You are a Prime member OR order is at least $25
# You are at least 18 years old OR have parent consent
# Your function should take four parameters
# prime (bool), cost (float), age (int), consent (bool)
# HUGE HINT!
# You can use more than one logical operator in a condition
# Use parenthesis to group if needed
