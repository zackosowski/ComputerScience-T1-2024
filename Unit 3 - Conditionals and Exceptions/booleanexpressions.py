# Boolean Expressions
# Kinda like a mathematical formula
# 14 + 10 = 24      Algebra uses arithmetic operators
# + - / * ** % //
# Can only evaluate to True or False
# 5 > 10 = False    Boolean Algebra uses comparison operators
# > < >= <= == !=

print(14 + 10)      #Algebra
print(5 > 10)       #Boolean Algebra

x = 6               # SET x equal to 5, tell it what to be
print(x == 6)       # GET x equals 5, ask a question

# This is the PERFECT test question
# What is the difference between = and == ?

print(4 >= 2)           # True
print(1993 == 1993)     # True
print(-90 < -99)        # False
print(10 != 10)         # False, "not"

# Boolean expressions quiz!
answer_one = input("Give me an integer that is negative\n>")
answer_one = int(answer_one)
print(answer_one < 0)

answer_two = input("Write the number 5\n>")
print(answer_two == "5")

print("Walrus" + "Walrus")  #   WalrusWalrus
print("Walrus" == "Walrus") #   True
